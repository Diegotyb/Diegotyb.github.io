        <h1> Final Project Game </h1>
        <p>For our game, called Gem Quest you have one goal which is to collect the Gem. 
            The main task that the character must do is get past the “troll” in the first scene. 
            The character must go back and get the sword. Once the character retrieves the sword, they charge the “troll” and eliminate him. 
            The character proceeds to go onto the next scene which is night time instead of day time. 
            He reaches the end where there is a treasure box and opens it. The treasure has the gem and the game is complete.
